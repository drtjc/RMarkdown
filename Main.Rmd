# How it works
A notebook is an interactive R Markdown file. The file contains three types of contents:

* An optional YAML header surrounded by `---`
* R code chunks surrounded by ` ``` `
* Text mixed with simple text formatting

# Code chunks
You can insert code chunks into your file with;

* The keyboard shortcut **Ctrl + Alt + I**
* The Add Chunk command in the editor toolbar
* The chunk delimiters ` ```{r} ` and ` ``` `



```{r}
x <- 1
x
```
